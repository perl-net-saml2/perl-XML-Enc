0.11 -- Sun Mar 19 09:39:31 ADT 2023

    [ Major change since 0.08 ]

    @NGEfreak asked if Crypt::Random could be replaced with Crypt::PRNG
    to eliminate the need for pari which requires network connectivity.
    Makes sense because CryptX is already a dependency.

    Known issue:

    rsa-oaep with different digests for the MGF and the label is broken and
    was broken from the initial implementation.

    This is being resolved via https://github.com/perl-net-saml2/perl-XML-Enc/pull/4
